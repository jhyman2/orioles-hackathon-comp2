<h3>What is Pitch Black?</h3>
<p>A predictive application that will inform a pitcher of where they can best ensure to throw a good pitch.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>It uses previous Pitch f/x data and calculates where batters perform their best and where they perform their worst.</p>

<h3>How will it be used?</h3>
<p>A manager or someone in the dugout can enter the batterâ€™s name and the current pitch count and will receive the best location to throw their pitch.</p>
